  Being a newbie to Clojure I was having a hard time understanding the use 
  case of apply; until tonight.  I was simply missing the fact that you use 
  apply when the argument list is unknown to a particular function that takes 
  something like [&amp; xs].  Once that big detail was in my head apply made 
  complete sense.

  Below is some examples I put together to try and get a handle on apply and 
  cement it in my brain.  Its really quite simple now that I did this.  I felt 
  like a complete idiot when the lightbulb went off; but isn't that with most 
  things.

  Clojure is really taking my mind for a loop compared to the OOP languages I have used in the last 13 years.
