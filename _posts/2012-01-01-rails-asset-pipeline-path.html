<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>
  I just ran into a little issue while fooling around with rails and 
  backbone.js.  I wanted to start using haml_coffee_assets for templates and 
  added the directory app/assets/templates.  When refreshing the page to try 
  and get ahold of the template I was getting an error 
  <b>Sprockets::FileOutsidePaths</b>.  Turns out I needed to restart WEBrick 
  in order for the assets path to be "reloaded"
</p>

<p>Just a quick gotcha!</p>
