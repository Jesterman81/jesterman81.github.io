<p>
  Today I ran across an issue where when running Spork and autotest the 
  factories that I added were not being reloaded. After some Googling I found 
  a simple solution which requires just two lines in the Spork.each_run block. 
  It looks like so

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1083159.js?file=spec_helper.rb"></script>

  reload_routes! and Factory.factories.clear do exactly what they say. The 
  Dir.glob reads all my factories out of the factories folder and loads each 
  on every run. Simple and to the point!
