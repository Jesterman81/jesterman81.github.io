<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>
  While working with a new rails project for my current employer I hooked up 
  Devise for authentication.  I wanted all redirects to for authenticate_user! 
  to be sent to /login.  Getting this to work was relatively easy and here is 
  the files I had to edit.

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1070145.js?file=application.rb"></script>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1070145.js?file=custom_failure_authentication.rb"></script>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1070145.js?file=devise.rb"></script>

  This was all I need to do to get the redirects working.
