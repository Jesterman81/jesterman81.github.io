<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>
  Ran across something I never did today.  I needed to pass in a param which 
  changed based on whether the route was nested or not.  So I could have 
  something like <i>/foo/1</i> and <i>/foo/1/bar/2</i>. 
</p>

<p>
  I am really after what the first number after <i>foo</i> is so I can verify 
  something in my before filter.  In the first example <i>/foo/<b>1</b></i> 
  the param being passed to the controller is :id.  In the second example 
  <i>/foo/<b>1</b>/bar/2</i> the param is :foo_id.
</p>

  After some digging I found the info I was looking for on the Rails Guides and came up up with this:

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1094239.js?file=some_controller.rb"></script>

  All my cucumber and rspec tests are green and I feel good!
