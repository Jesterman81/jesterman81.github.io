<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>Another issue arose tonight where launchy was screaming at me about Capybara save_and_open_page method using an old API.

  <pre>
  WARNING: You made a call to a deprecated Launchy API. This call should be changed to 'Launchy.open( uri )'
  </pre>

  To fix this I simply updated my gem file to include what version of launchy I was using like so:
</p>

<p>
  <b>gem 'launchy', '0.4.0'</b>
</p>
<p>
  Next update bundler from the command prompt
</p>

<p>
  <b>bundle update launchy</b>
</p>

<p>
  Bingo, I'm seeing pages again...
</p>
