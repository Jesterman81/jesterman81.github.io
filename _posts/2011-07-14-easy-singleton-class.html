<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>
  I was perusing thru the Rails source code in the ActiveSupport component and 
  ran across this <i>gem</i>
</p>

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1083989.js?file=singleton_class.rb"></script>

  The interesting part for me was the <i>singleton_class</i> method.  What a 
  nice handy tool to put in the tool box.
