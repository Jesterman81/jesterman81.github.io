<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>
  Ran into something pretty slick today with Ruby arrays.  The &amp; operator and the - operator.
  <br/>
  So if you do something along the lines of [1,2,3,4,5] &amp; [4,5,6,7] you'll get the intersection of the two arrays [4,5].
  <br/>
  And if you do something like [1,2,3,4,5] - [3,4,5] you'll get the difference of the two arrays [1,2].
</p>

Just a little ruby elegance!
